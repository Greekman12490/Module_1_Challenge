#Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This project is to help Louise see the different campaigns and how they performed in relation to launch dates and fundraising goals. You will see via through images of graphs and the excel worksheet provided how certain outcomes play out. Hopefully, with the data given, a decision can be made that can help Louise further her goals. However, this data is limited strictly to plays with certain later sheets as the criteria was strictly asking for that.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	
If we look at the numbers for each month, their are more successful plays than that of the failed and canceled plays combined for each month. Which, is a good thing. When we consider the seasons, such as Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall. We see that, during the Spring months of March through May, the successful outcomes 		increase significantly.Afterwards, they drop gradually until the fall seasons, where they pick up in October, but, fall again until December. In December, we notice that the successful and failed are nearly the same. We can take into the account of the holiday season, where people are more so spending money and time for their familes and/or loved ones. If we consider holidays such as Valentine's Day, Christmas, and/or Thanksgiving, we see certain months are effected. For example, February has an increase of successful plays compared to January.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

With goals increasing by every five thousand dollars ($5,000), starting at one thousand dollars ($1,000), we notice that your likelihood of that goal succeeding becomes less. Once you try to set a goal between fifteen to around thirty-five thousand dollars ($15,000 - $34,999), you will more likely fail at obtaining that goal. However, between thirty-five and forty thousand dollars ($35,000 - $40,000), you are more likely to succeed. What we can get out of this, keep your goals small or within a certain threshold if you want to be successful. It is okay, to set certain goals where others have failed, but, something has to be done differently that warrants success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

One difficulty I experienced with this challenge was if you enter a formula wrong, you will get data that doesn't fit the norm of the results. In other words, the results came back different than the correct display of the results. I went back and changed the equation that brought me that correct results. Certain equations that were involved needed more understanding of the logic behind it. This is normal and should be done first with any equation and/or code. In the long run, it will help me be better at analytics.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

In the spring, it is more likely for plays to be successful than the winter. Mother's Day, which is in May, peaks the increase fof success The amount of unsuccessful plays stay relatively the same throughout the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	
Keep the goals small (below fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000)) or within the threshold of thirty-five to forty thousand dollars ($35,000 - $40,000)  to be more successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	
Being that it is just plays, you're limiting the potential of other outcomes such as musicals and theater spaces. The likelihood of success would increase that way.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	
A bar graph could take the place of the line graph. It could be easier to read depending on the individual.
